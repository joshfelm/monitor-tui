# Monitor-tui

Ever wanted to change your monitor layout in your terminal using a GUI?
No? Well here's an app that will let you do it anyway.

Based on rust tui, you can see your monitors as they appear, and modify

terminal!

Save your layouts using autorandr, export to monitors.xml and more (coming
